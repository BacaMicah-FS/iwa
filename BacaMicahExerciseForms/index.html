            <strong>Runescape</strong>
            is a fantasy massively multiplayer online role-playing game
            <strong>(MMORPG)</strong>
            developed and published by Jagex, released in January 2001.
            RuneScape was originally a browser game built with the Java
            programming language; it was largely replaced by a standalone C++
            client in 2016. The game has had over 300 million accounts created
            and was recognised by the Guinness World Records as the largest and
            most-updated free <em>(MMORPG)</em>.[2]

          <p>
            Players begin in a secluded area called Tutorial Island, where they
            are taken through a tutorial, a set path where they learn the most
            basic skills in RuneScape.[15][16] After the tutorial, players have
            access to tutors and advisors located in the towns they explore, who
            can give players appropriate information about their respective
            skills.[17] Originally players were teleported to the town of
            Lumbridge, however in recent updates, Burthorpe is the main starting
            area.[18] Other main cities include Varrock, Falador, Ardougne (and
            West Ardougne), and smaller settlements.[19][20][21]

          <h3>Skills</h3>
          <p>
            Here are 29 skills in <em>Runescape</em>, 17 skills available to
            free-to-play players and an additional 12 for members, which enable
            players to perform various activities allowing for interaction with
            <em>NPCs</em>, the environment and other players. Players gain
            experience points in a skill when they use it. For example, mining
            an ore trains the mining skill, and when the player accumulates
            enough experience points in the skill, their character will "level
            up".[23] As a skill level rises, the ability to retrieve better raw
            materials and produce better products increases, as does the
            experience awarded if the player uses new abilities. The total skill
            level of a player partly symbolises the player's status in the game
            and subscribers with a high total level can appear on the high
            scores.[24] Upon reaching the highest available level in a skill,
            members may buy a special cape to symbolise their achievement.[25]

          <p>
            Andrew Gower developed RuneScape with the assistance of his brother
            Paul Gower.[57] It was originally conceived as a text-based MUD, but
            graphics were incorporated early in development, adding it to the
            ranks of what were then known as "graphicalMUDs
            <em><strong>MUDs</strong></em
            >".[58][59] The first public version of the game used a mixture of
            three-dimensional and two-dimensional sprites. It was released as a
            beta version on 4 January 2001, and originally operated out of their
            parents' house in Nottingham.[57]

          <h2 id="quests">Quests</h2>
          <p>
            Quests are series of tasks with a storyline that players can choose
            to complete. These often have requirements including minimum levels
            in certain skills, combat levels, quest points and/or the completion
            of other quests. Players receive various rewards for completion of
            quests, including money, unique items, access to new areas, quest
            points and/or increases in skill experience. Some quests require
            players to work together, and many require players to engage in
            challenging combat. Quests are grouped into categories based on
            requirements and difficulty.[56] Once a player completes all quests
            in the game, an achievement item known as the "Quest Point Cape"
            <em>"Quest Point Cape"</em> can be claimed.[25] New quests are
            released periodically.
