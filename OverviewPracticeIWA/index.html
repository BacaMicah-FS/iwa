          is the technology that defines the content and structure of any
          website. Written properly, it should also define the semantics
          (meaning) of the content in a machine-readable way, which is vital for
          accessibility, search engine optimization, and making use of the
          built-in features browsers provide for content to work optimally. This
          module covers the basics of the language, before looking at key areas
          such as document structure, links, lists, images, forms, and more.
          Prerequisites Before starting this module, you don't need any previous
          HTML knowledge, but you should have at least basic familiarity with
          using computers and using the web passively (i.e., just looking at it
          and consuming content). You should have a basic work environment set
          up (as detailed in Installing basic software), and understand how to
          create and manage files (as detailed in Dealing with files). Both are
          parts of our Getting started with the web complete beginner's module.

          (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages â€” for
          example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content,
          split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative
          features. This module provides all the CSS fundamentals you'll need
          for now, including syntax, features, and techniques. Prerequisites
          Before starting this module, you should have a basic work environment
          set up (as detailed in Installing basic software), and understand how
          to create and manage files (as detailed in Dealing with files). You
          should also be familiar with HTML (work through our Structuring
          content with HTML module if not). CSS allows you to create
          great-looking web pages, but how does it work under the hood? This
          article explains what CSS, what the basic syntax looks like, and how
          your browser applies CSS to HTML to style it.

          element formally defines a form and attributes that determine the
          form's behavior. Each time you want to create an HTML form, you must
          start it by using this element, nesting all the contents inside. Many
          assistive technologies and browser plugins can discover form elements
          and implement special hooks to make them easier to use. It's always
          possible to use a form control outside of a form element. If you do
          so, by default that control has nothing to do with any form unless you
          associate it with a form using its form attribute. This was introduced
          to let you explicitly bind a control with a form even if it is not
          nested inside it. Let's move forward and cover the structural elements
          you'll find nested in a form.
