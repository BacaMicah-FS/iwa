          <i><b>Runescape</b></i>
          is a fantasy massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG)
          developed and published by Jagex, released in January 2001. RuneScape
          was originally a browser game built with the Java programming
          language; it was largely replaced by a standalone C++ client in 2016.
          The game has had over 300 million accounts created and was recognised
          by the Guinness World Records as the largest and most-updated free
          MMORPG.[2]

          Players begin in a secluded area called <i>Tutorial Island</i>, where
          they are taken through a tutorial, a set path where they learn the
          most basic skills in RuneScape.[15][16] After the tutorial, players
          have access to tutors and advisors located in the towns they explore,
          who can give players appropriate information about their respective
          skills.[17] Originally players were teleported to the town of
          Lumbridge, however in recent updates, Burthorpe is the main starting
          area.[18] Other main cities include Varrock, Falador, Ardougne (and
          West Ardougne), and smaller settlements.[19][20][21]

        <h3>Skills</h3>
        <p>
          here are 29 skills in RuneScape, 17 skills available to free-to-play
          players and an additional 12 for members, which enable players to
          perform various activities allowing for interaction with <b>NPCs</b>,
          the environment and other players. Players gain experience points in a
          skill when they use it. For example, mining an ore trains the mining
          skill, and when the player accumulates enough experience points in the
          skill, their character will "level up".[23] As a skill level rises,
          the ability to retrieve better raw materials and produce better
          products increases, as does the experience awarded if the player uses
          new abilities. The total skill level of a player partly symbolises the
          player's status in the game and subscribers with a high total level
          can appear on the high scores.[24] Upon reaching the highest available
          level in a skill, members may buy a special cape to symbolise their
          achievement.[25]

        <p>
          Andrew Gower developed RuneScape with the assistance of his brother
          Paul Gower.[57] It was originally conceived as a text-based MUD, but
          graphics were incorporated early in development, adding it to the
          ranks of what were then known as "graphical <em><b>MUDs</b></em
          >".[58][59] The first public version of the game used a mixture of
          three-dimensional and two-dimensional sprites. It was released as a
          beta version on 4 January 2001, and originally operated out of their
          parents' house in Nottingham.[57]

        <h2 id="quests">Quests</h2>
        <p>
          Quests are series of tasks with a storyline that players can choose to
          complete. These often have requirements including minimum levels in
          certain skills, combat levels, quest points and/or the completion of
          other quests. Players receive various rewards for completion of
          quests, including money, unique items, access to new areas, quest
          points and/or increases in skill experience. Some quests require
          players to work together, and many require players to engage in
          challenging combat. Quests are grouped into categories based on
          requirements and difficulty.[56] Once a player completes all quests in
          the game, an achievement item known as the
          <i>"Quest Point Cape"</i> can be claimed.[25] New quests are released
          periodically.
